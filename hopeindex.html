<title> "Hope is a Thing With Feathers.." </title>
<h1> One of the most uplifting poems...
  </h1>


<blockquote cite="http://https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/42889">
<br>
    "Hope" is the thing with feathers -<br>
That perches in the soul -<br>
And sings the tune without the words -<br>
And never stops -
<br>at all -<br>
<br>
And sweetest -<br> in the Gale -<br> is heard -<br>
And sore must be the storm -<br>
That could abash the little Bird<br>
That kept so many warm -<br>
<br>
I've heard it in the chillest land -<br>
And on the strangest Sea -<br>
Yet - never - in Extremity,<br>
It asked a crumb - of me.<br>

<h3> BY Emily Dickinson </h3>


  <p1><blockquote><b>
    I have so much chaos in my life, it's become normal. You become used to it.
    You have to just relax, calm down, take a deep breath and
    try to see how you can make things work rather
    than complain about how they're wrong. -Tom Welling </blockquote>

        <p2>When a person starts to talk about their dreams, it's as if
          something bubbles up from within. Their eyes brighten, their face glows,
          and you can feel the excitement in their words.-John C. Maxwell  </p2>

  <h2>  The message is to creatively embrace chaos and change</h2>
